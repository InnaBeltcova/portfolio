        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>When it comes to cloud organization, one size fits all approach doesn’t always work. This is especially true for design professionals that use multiple software tools and have specific demands for content management. Solutions that are currently available either include too many unnecessary features or don’t have enough functionality. Professional designers need a cloud storage solution that will successfully integrate with the design software, provide robust collaboration, search, and organization features.
        </p>

      <article class="solution">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>Through the iterative design process that included user research, competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing I created a content management system tailored to the needs of professional designers. It features a real-time collaboration via a built-in messaging app, a variety of templates for the design projects, an integration with most of the design tools and software, and enhanced security with an option to set a sharing link expiration.

        <h4>Competitive analysis
        </h4>
        <p>I performed a competitive analysis of cloud storage platforms that have a different approach to the way they provide their services. Google Drive is a well-established brand that offers the largest amount of free storage and is fully consolidated with Gmail. Apple i-Cloud targets a specific audience - Apple users and provides seamless integration with iOS apps. Evernote focuses on note-taking features and works well across all platforms.

        <h4>User survey
        </h4>
        <p>To find out frustrations, goals, and motivations of potential users I created a user survey. Most of the people that participated in my survey are designers, which is the primary target audience. 100% of them use cloud storage services (the most popular being Google Drive and Dropbox).
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="73">
        <p>73.3% of respondents use cloud storage for collaboration. My initial hypothesis about the desire of users to use cloud storage for real-time collaboration for editing documents was wrong. I’ve discovered that they prefer messaging and currently use social media texting services for this purpose.
        </p>
        <article class="93">
          <p>93.8% of respondents indicated that the feature they use most frequently is uploading files from a computer or a mobile device. The least used feature is saving links, images, videos users find on the web - 6%.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="most">
          <p>Most of the respondents organize content into folders. When asked if they could add a new way to organize the content, what would they choose, most participants said that they are happy with folders. A handful of users indicated that they would label files by iconography, author, file type and priority.

          </h4>
          <p> 26 y.o. / Junior UI Designer / Raleigh, NC / married, no kids
            Motivations
            Rada works long hours and is often assigned projects with very short deadlines. She has numerous files that contain graphics. The cloud storage that she uses at work doesn’t provide an option to preview those files which makes searching for the right document tedious and time-consuming. Rada usually has lots of versions of the same files, so having a robust version-control system is one of the most important features for her.
            Frustrations
            •   Not being able to edit some
            types of documents
            •   No preview of Adobe

            In juggling a full-time job, family and a house organization is key.  Jane has to pick up her kids from school every day and doesn’t have a luxury of staying late in the office. To meet the projects’  deadlines, her work flow has to be 100% efficient. She needs to be able to locate all of her enormous number of files in seconds.

        <article class="conclP1">
          <p>With Serious Drive I wanted to create a no-nonsense type of product that “doesn’t make users think” (paraphrasing Steve Krug’s statement). I enjoyed going through all the iterations seeing how it was improving on every stage. Particularly, the last round of usability testing was very satisfying, it showed a high success rate making me think that my goal was achieved.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="conclP2">
          <p>During this project, I learned how important it is to get the “fresh look” of other people on the design problems I’m working on. I understood the power of preference testing when I was having a hard time deciding between two solutions of the same problem.
          </p>
        </article>
      <article class="conclP3">
          <p>While working on the hi-fi prototype I reaffirmed my thoughts about the necessity of coding out prototypes in some cases. Particularly when functionality of prototyping tools like Invision or Figma isn’t enough to show the flow or animations that are a vital part of the product we are designing.  I’ll be definitely doing that for my upcoming projects when applicable.
